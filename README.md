#LinkSniffer
##Currently Under Development
###This repo is for a dev challenge.

####Play Time Challenge 4
Create a basic HTML5 site with several text links (local and external links). Use jQuery to identify the links that link externally and add an image to these to show that they link to external web sites. 
 
No APIs/frameworks/etc. may be used that do this automatically for you: you may only use jQuery and standard JavaScript to accomplish this.
